Procedurally generated trees using a recursion algorithm, which creates geometry data using a seed for randomness and the UProceduralMeshComponent 
![Image1](READMEAssets/1.png)

Procedural generated terrain created with a chunk-loading based system, by creating points in a grid and offsetting them vertically by querying a noise function.

Terrain LOD algorithm that renders furthest chunks at a lower resolution, to optimise framerate and chunk loading.
