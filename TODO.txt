make bark different texture at bases
	- done but UVs are weird

make trees async generated

- save/load from file
	- when loading from save file, check which chunks are in the save file and load that chunk with all its data, otherwise generate new chunk data

Ideas:
certain trees grow at night - more reason to go at night
diminishing returns on types of wood - others increase in value over time till collected - eg contract system/pinboard outside
trees drop acorns

Notes:
Right now, we have the TreeRoot initiating a generation sequence for the tree. It spawns one log, and calls a function on that log to recursively generate
the rest of the logs.

What causes lag:
Initial generation of the tree; possibly the recursive spawning of a new log or the fact that everything has a box collision could be the cause.
FPS Lag is caused by the meshes- Turning off mesh generation while keeping collisions caused no long term lag.
This opts for a modular solution to generation, to be able to control LOD levels

Its tested that mesh generation doesn't cause lag, instead its either the act of spawning each log or the engine needing to initialize the box collision component of the tree.
The advantage of this is there is no outer "parent" for the whole tree, the parent for all trees is the first log.
Problem with this is its hard to modularise the generation process, eg if we want meshes to generate separate to the collision and vertices calculations its hard to,
since everything is dependent on the last step.

We are going to move to a different generation method, where we first generate the data in the TreeRoot actor, then from there it will generate the rest of the logs using that data

TreeRoot will generate an array of LogData classes, which will contain the data for each log, containing its parent class.

We want to be able to have different LOD levels for trees and combine the generation with the terrain generation to enable fully functional chunkloading with other aspects of
that chunk, eg trees, buildsing, etc

Loading Chunk:
	LoadChunk initiates steps to load parts of a chunk, like terrain, trees, etc.
	Each step will call a callback function to indicate that part of generation has completed.
	This callback function, called for example "OnFinishedGeneration" will tick the render state variable for that procedure, always checking the state of other renders.
	Once all states, eg: TreeRenderState, TerrainRenderState and BuildingRenderState are all "Rendered", tick the final ChunkRenderState to "Rendered".

	Problem: Spawning tree root actors cause a lot of lag since it needs to be done on the game thread.

Chunk loading workflow:
	-eg: Chunk 1 needs loading
	- Chunk gets split into parts, eg: Loading trees, loading buildings, loading terrain
	- Each part has a class Loader assigned to it, eg: TreeLoader, TerrainLoader, BuildingLoader, FUTURE: Could have Loader class
	- These classes need to be able to have a function to be called to make it start generating, and a function that gets called once its part is done.
