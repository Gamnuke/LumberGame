make bark different texture at bases
	- done but UVs are weird

make trees async generated

- save/load from file
	- when loading from save file, check which chunks are in the save file and load that chunk with all its data, otherwise generate new chunk data

Ideas:
certain trees grow at night - more reason to go at night
diminishing returns on types of wood - others increase in value over time till collected - eg contract system/pinboard outside
trees drop acorns
